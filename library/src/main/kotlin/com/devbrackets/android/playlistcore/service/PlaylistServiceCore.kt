/**
 * A base service for adding media playback support using the [BasePlaylistManager].
 *
 *
 * This service will request a wifi wakelock if the item being played isn't
 * downloaded (see [.isDownloaded]) and the manifest permission
 * &lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" /&gt;
 * has been specified.  This will allow the audio to be played without interruptions.
 *
 *
 * Due to not knowing the actual class for the playlist service, if you want to handle
 * audio becoming noisy (e.g. when a headphone cable is pulled out) then you will need
 * to create your own [android.content.BroadcastReceiver] as outlined at
 * [http://developer.android.com/guid/topics/media/mediaplayer.html#noisyintent](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/mediaplayer.html#noisyintent)
